# What is Quantum Supremacy?

Quantum supremacy is the milestone when a quantum computer can solve a problem that classical computers cannot solve in a reasonable amount of time. It's a significant achievement in the field of quantum computing.

## Key Points:
- **Definition**: When quantum computers outperform classical computers
- **First Achievement**: Google claimed quantum supremacy in 2019
- **Controversy**: IBM disputed the claim
- **Significance**: Marks a new era in computing

## The Road Ahead:
Quantum supremacy is just the beginning. The real challenge is building practical, error-corrected quantum computers that can solve real-world problems.
