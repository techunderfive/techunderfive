# What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is a **completely new way of computing** that uses the laws of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike traditional computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use **qubits**, which can be 0, 1, or both at once (thanks to superposition).

>Traditional computers solve problems step-by-step. Quantum computers can explore **many possibilities at once**, making them powerful for tasks like cryptography, AI, and simulations.

# Why Is It Called "Quantum" Computing?

The name comes from **quantum mechanics**—the branch of physics that describes how particles behave at the atomic and subatomic level. Quantum computers harness principles like:

- **Superposition** (being in multiple states at once)
- **Entanglement** (instant correlation between particles)
- **Interference** (canceling or enhancing outcomes)

These behaviors don't exist in classical systems—hence, "quantum" computing.

# Core Parts of Quantum Computing (Explained Simply)

## Qubits
- The quantum version of a classical bit.
- Can be in 0, 1, or both states simultaneously (superposition).

## Superposition
A classical bit is either 0 or 1. A qubit can be **0 and 1 at the same time**.

 **Analogy:** Like a spinning coin. Until it lands, it’s not just heads or tails—it’s both in a blur of possibilities.

 **How it's done:** Qubits reach this state using gates like the **Hadamard gate**, which puts the qubit into an equal-weighted superposition. It’s not magic—it’s math at the quantum scale.

## Entanglement

> Two qubits become **entangled** when the state of one depends on the other—even across vast distances.

**Example:** If you measure one entangled qubit, the other will instantly respond—even if it's across the planet.

**How they get entangled:** Typically, by applying a **CNOT gate** after a Hadamard gate. It links their quantum states so that measuring one affects the outcome of the other.

> It's not about being physically attached—it's about shared quantum information. Entanglement is created through interaction, not distance.

## Measurement

> Qubits stay in their "quantum" form until measured. Once observed, their state **collapses** to either 0 or 1.

Think of measurement as choosing an outcome from a sea of probabilities—guided by math, not dice rolls.
