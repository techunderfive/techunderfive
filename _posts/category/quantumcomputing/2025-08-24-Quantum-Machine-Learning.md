# Quantum Machine Learning Overview

Quantum machine learning combines quantum computing with classical machine learning techniques to potentially solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

## Quantum Neural Networks:
- **Structure**: Quantum circuits that mimic neural networks
- **Advantage**: Can process quantum data naturally
- **Applications**: Quantum chemistry, optimization

## Quantum-Classical Hybrid:
- **Approach**: Combine quantum and classical processing
- **Benefits**: Leverage strengths of both paradigms
- **Examples**: Variational quantum algorithms

## Potential Applications:
- **Drug Discovery**: Simulate molecular interactions
- **Financial Modeling**: Portfolio optimization
- **Climate Science**: Complex system modeling
- **Image Recognition**: Quantum-enhanced pattern matching

## Current State:
While still in early stages, quantum machine learning shows promise for specific applications where quantum properties provide natural advantages over classical methods.
