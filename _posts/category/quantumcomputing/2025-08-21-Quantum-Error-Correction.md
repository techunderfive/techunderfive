# Why Quantum Error Correction Matters

Quantum computers are incredibly sensitive to noise and errors. Unlike classical computers, quantum systems can't simply copy information to prevent errors due to the no-cloning theorem.

## The Challenge:
- **Decoherence**: Qubits lose their quantum state quickly
- **Noise**: Environmental factors cause errors
- **No Cloning**: Can't simply copy quantum information

## The Solution:
Quantum error correction uses multiple physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit, allowing us to detect and correct errors without destroying the quantum information.

## Current Status:
While theoretical frameworks exist, practical quantum error correction is still in development and represents one of the biggest challenges in quantum computing.
