# Quantum Cryptography Basics

Quantum cryptography uses the principles of quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels that are theoretically impossible to hack.

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):
- **Principle**: Uses quantum properties to detect eavesdropping
- **Security**: Based on laws of physics, not computational difficulty
- **Implementation**: Already commercially available

## How It Works:
1. **Quantum States**: Sender encodes information in quantum states
2. **Measurement**: Any measurement disturbs the quantum state
3. **Detection**: Eavesdropping can be detected through disturbance
4. **Security**: If no eavesdropping detected, key is secure

## Current Applications:
- **Banking**: Secure financial transactions
- **Government**: Classified communications
- **Healthcare**: Secure medical data transmission

## The Challenge:
While quantum cryptography can secure communications, quantum computers could break existing encryption methods, creating a race between quantum security and quantum attacks.
