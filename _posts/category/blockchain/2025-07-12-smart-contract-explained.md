## What Are Smart Contracts? {#what-is-smartcontracts}

 **Smart contract** is a self-executing program living on a **blockchain** that encodes “if X, then Y” agreements and automatically carries them out once its conditions are satisfied—no middleman required. Once deployed, it behaves **autonomously**, running exactly as written **without any human intervention**; is **deterministic**, so you can be sure it will always produce the same result given the same inputs; and operates in a **trustless environment**, meaning that participants don’t need to trust one another—only the underlying protocol.

Consider a **crowdfunding campaign**—a popular way to raise small amounts of capital from many backers via an online platform. A **smart contract** can automate all of its core rules:

1. **Deadline Enforcement**
Contributions are only accepted until a fixed end time; once the deadline passes, the contract simply rejects any new funds.
2. **Minimum Contribution**
Each pledge must meet a defined floor (for example, 0.01 ETH). Any amount below that threshold is automatically turned away.
3. **Finalization Guard**
Only after the deadline can the campaign be “finalized,” and this step can occur just once—eliminating the risk of duplicate payouts.
4. **Goal Verification**
Upon finalization, the smart contract compares the total raised to the funding target. If the goal is met or exceeded, it transfers all funds to the project owner.
5. **Refund Mechanism**
If the goal falls short by deadline, contributors regain their deposits. Refunds open only after the campaign ends—and only for those who actually backed it.
6. **Safety Against Reentrancy**
Before issuing any refund, the contract zeroes out the backer’s balance to prevent malicious re-entry attempts from draining funds.

By enforcing **“require X, then proceed”** logic at each step, the smart contract guarantees that payouts or refunds happen only when every **prewritten condition is satisfied**—ensuring a predictable, secure crowdfunding process.

## How Smart Contracts Differ from Everyday Code? {#difference-code-vs-smartcontarct}

You might be wondering: **aren’t smart contracts just “if-this-then-that” scripts like any other code**? At their core, smart contracts do follow “if X, then Y, else Z” logic—but what truly distinguishes them is where they run, how they execute, and why we use them.

      </td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Deployed on a distributed blockchain network.<br>
        • Immutable and trustless—no one can stop or alter execution once live.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Software updates and patches are common and straightforward.<br>

      </td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">

    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Bugs can be patched or rolled back easily.<br>
        • Live debugging and hot fixes are possible.
      </td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Bugs can permanently lock or drain real funds.<br>
        • Requires formal audits, extensive testing, and safety patterns.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Code runs until you terminate the process or hit system limits.<br>
        • No per-operation cost.
      </td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
        • Each operation (storage, loops, etc.) consumes gas.<br>
        • Forces lean, predictable logic to avoid unbounded loops.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


In essence, while smart contracts use familiar “if-this-then-that” logic, running that logic on a decentralized, immutable ledger turns basic branching into trustless, self-executing agreements. Without smart contracts, a blockchain is merely a tamper-proof record; with them, it becomes a global, autonomous computer.
